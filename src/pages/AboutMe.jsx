              Iâ€™m a quirky and young aspiring Full-Stack Developer with a
              passion for crafting seamless web applications based in Melbourne.
              My main mission in life, is to try my best in any situation. After
              graduating from high school, I wanted to get in to coding. So with
              no doubt in my mind, I went on to complete my Bachelor of Computer
              Science (Professional) at Swinburne University, graduating with
              Distinction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I'm honing my skills as a Web Developer, where I am
              diving headfirst into the world of software development and
              soaking in new concepts and technologies. I thrive in
              collaborative environments and approach each project with
              meticulous attention to detail.
            </p>
            <p>
              My technical toolkit includes Front-end technologies like HTML,
              React, TypeScript, Vue.js and Tailwind; Back-end frameworks like
              Node.js, PHP and Laravel; and DevOps tools like AWS and Docker.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of coding, I'm a passionate enthusiast of both modern and
              retro gaming. Spend my free time playing the best video games have
              to offer and collect retro games. I'm also an Advanced Certified
              PADI Scuba Diver who loves exploring ocean depths and exploring
              the unknown, and a passionate supporter of the Essendon Bombers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can be pretty adventurous. You can catch me travelling to new
              destinations, drinking a Bourbon and Coke and sharing a good laugh
              with my friends and family.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether building innovative web solutions or exploring new
              frontiers, I'm always ready for the next challenge. Let's connect
              and create something amazing together.
